# REST APIs Design

This folder contains the full Open API documentation of the REST APIs, including examples of JSON documents to be used when invoking the operations.

**NOTE:** the `openAPI.yaml` file stored here is the exact copy of the file stored inside the ``ToDoManager Implementation/Server/api`` folder.
